What is the difference between a merge and rebase?

A merge keeps the source branch of the changes intact and preserves the 
history, whereas a rebase moves those changes to the destination branch and
rewrites the history to flatten it.


What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a copy of your repository (i.e. your code) on somewhere
that's not an individual user's computer (most often the cloud). So, you have
a local copy of the code on your computer and a copy that's stored elsewhere.
